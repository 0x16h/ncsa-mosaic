=NCSA Mosaic=

This is NCSA Mosaic 2.7, one of the first graphical web browsers.
If you're on Ubuntu or something like it, your time machine is fueled
up and ready to go.  Follow the instructions below to build and run.

Many thanks to Sean MacLennan and Alan Wylie for doing the heavy lifting.

==Building==

* I was able to compile and run on Ubuntu 9.10. You'll have to install these packages first:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libmotif3 libmotif-dev libpng3 

* Next, build with:

    make linux

* Run!

    src/Mosaic

==How?==

I started with this: http://seanm.ca/mosaic/ and applied the patch on the page.  I pulled a bunch of getline()'s out.  Presto.
