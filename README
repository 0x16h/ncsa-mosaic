=NCSA Mosaic=

==Building==

* I was able to compile and run on Ubuntu 9.10. You'll have to install these packages first:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libmotif3 libmotif-dev libpng3 

* Next, build with:

    make linux

* Run!

    src/Mosaic

==Thanks==

I started with this: http://seanm.ca/mosaic/ and applied the patch on the page.  I pulled a bunch of getline()'s out.  Presto.
